    <p>Vi går i produksjon med endringene nedenfor 1. november 2023.</p>
    <p>I samarbeid med Statens sivilrettsforvaltning arbeider vi med å utvide registeret med mer detaljert informasjon om Vergemål, samt  innføre «Begrensning i rettslig handleevne» som en ny entitet.</p>
    <p>Vi lanserte endringer allerede tilbake i 2022-06-30. Det er en justering siden dette. Det vi tidligere kalte &#39;Fratatt rettslig handleevne&#39; er nå døpt om til &#39;Begrensning i rettslig handleevne&#39;. Fratatt ligger i modellen, men vil aldri inneholde data.</p>
    <p>Hendelsesbeskrivelser og informasjonsmodell er <a href="https://skatteetaten.github.io/folkeregisteret-api-dokumentasjon/informasjonsmodell/">oppdatert</a></p>
    <p>Swaggerhub for personer og hendelser er oppdatert. Endringene i Swagger er bakoverkompatibel, så den kan taes i bruk allerede nå. Gammel OpenAPISpec vil fungere inntil vi deler data i de nye informasjonselementene.
    XSD endepunktene til de forskjellige rettighetspakkene vil fortsatt gi eksisterende modell (v.1.5), den blir oppdatert i løpet av august når sommerfrys er over.</p>
    <p>Det vil komme data i de nye feltene 1.november. Hvilke rettighetspakker som får tilgang til hvilken informasjon er beskrevet i Informasjonsmodell dokumentet. </p>
    <p>For vergemål er ny informasjon en detaljering av dagens vergemålsomfang (&#39;vergemålEllerFremtidsfullmakt.verge.omfang&#39;), denne informasjonen vil fra produksjonsdato ligge på entiteten &#39;vergemålEllerFremtidsfullmakt.verge.tjenesteområde&#39;.
    Vi flytter også vergens navn til &#39;vergemålEllerFremtidsfullmakt.verge.navnFødselsdato&#39;, som også har støtte for mer identifiserende informasjon.
    &#39;omfang og &#39;navn&#39; blir altså erstattet fra og med produksjonsdato og vi slutter da å levere data i de feltene. </p>
    <p>Begrensning i rettslig handleevne er et nytt informasjonselement som kun har metadata. Dersom en Begrensning i rettslig handleevne er gjeldende har personen en begrensning.</p>
    <p>Testdata blir tilgjenegelig i august.</p>

                <p>Folkeregisteret lagrer i dag grensejusteringer i Folkeregisteret, men vi lagrer ikke nøyaktig ikrafttredelsesdato.</p>
    <p>Eksempel 1 på hva «grensejustering» er:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Fra nyttår 2020 ligger Bryggegata 2 i Mandal by i Lindesnes kommune og ikke i Mandal kommune.</li>
    <li>Vi oppdaterte databasen får 30. desember, og har ikke lagret ikrafttredelsesdatoen 1. januar 2020.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Eksempel 2:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Stubbegata bytter fra å ligge i Stavanger kommune til å ligge i Sola kommune fra 1. oktober 2019.</li>
    <li>Vi lagrer endringen i databasen 8. oktober, og lagrer ikke at ikrafttredelsesdatoen var 1. oktober.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Har du som konsument behov for å vite nøyaktig dato for når slike endringer trer i kraft?
    Hvis du vet det hadde vært fint å kunne få den informasjonen, så vennligst svar i dette skjemaet senest 26. oktober 2022: <a href="https://forms.office.com/r/pUAGUXNx90">https://forms.office.com/r/pUAGUXNx90</a>

Gammel XSD vil fungere inntil vi deler data på de nye feltene. Det vil tidligst komme data på de nye feltene 1. oktober. Vi forventer at data på Fratatt rettslig handleevne vil deles før endringene på Vergemål. Det er ikke avklart hvilke rettighetspakker som får tilgang til hvilken informasjon. </p>
    <p>For vergemål er ny informasjon en detaljering av dagens vergemålsomfang. Vi vil i en periode i parallell, dele både ny og gammel overlappende informasjon. På lengre sikt, og med fire måneders varsel, vil vergemålsomfang fases ut. </p>
    <p>Vi vil komme tilbake med funksjonell beskrivelse av den nye informasjonen som tilgjengeliggjøres.</p>

                <h3 id="bakgrunn-br-">Bakgrunn<br/></h3>
    <p>I 2017 ble det innført en bestemmelse i Folkeregisterforskriften (§2-2-2, tredje ledd) som gjør at et d-nummer i Folkeregisteret automatisk settes som inaktivt fem år etter det ble til tildelt en person.
    I januar 2022 er det fem år siden bestemmelsen ble innført. Det betyr at den automatiske inaktiveringen av d-nummer etter planen begynner medio januar 2022 og deretter skjer løpende.<br/>
    <br/>Det er ca. 640 000 d-numre som er tildelt før januar 2017 og som umiddelbart vil inaktiveres. Det er ikke besluttet om disse d-numrene vil inaktiveres samtidig eller om det vil gjøres i større batcher i løpet av et kortere tidsrom. Konsumentene av folkeregisteret må være forberedt på et større volum av hendelser den perioden ev. batcher kjøres. Det vil komme nærmere informasjon så snart gjennomføringsrutinen er besluttet.<br/>
    <br/>Følgende hendelser vil publiseres:<br/>
    FREG: Hendelsen &#39;endringIStatus&#39;<br/>
    TRANS-FIL: Årsakskode 92 - Endring av D-nummer informasjon</p>
    <h3 id="hva-skjer-ved-en-inaktivering-br-">Hva skjer ved en inaktivering<br/></h3>
    <p>Når en D-nummer-person inaktiveres settes personstatusen til personen til &#39;inaktiv&#39;. Identifikatorstatusen forandres ikke og vil fortsatt være &#39;iBruk&#39;. Gyldighetstidspunktet for inaktivering settes til tidspunktet inaktivering skjer; dvs. beslutningstidspunktet. Det er kun personens status som endres og alle andre entiteter er uforandret.
    Det opprinnelige d-nummeret kan reaktiveres. Det betyr at det ikke skal rekvireres nye d-nummer til personer med inaktivt d-nummer.<br/><br/>Reaktivering kan gjøres ved at brukeren møter opp til ID-kontroll ved et skattekontor og ber om dette. Rekvirenter av d-nummer kan også reaktivere et d-nummer.</p>

                <p>Flere konsumenter har oppdaget avvik på sine adresser og de adressene som ligger i FREG. Avvikene går på at FREG har Adressetilleggsnavn uten at dette er distribuert i hendelseslisten. Årsaken til at dette ikke er distribuert er at 
    Ved migrering av adresser fra DSF til FREG, så beriket vi bostedsadressene med adressetilleggsnavn. Det  ble ikke laget hendelser ved migrering. Det betyr at dere (konsumentene) ikke er varslet om at bostedsadressene er oppdatert av adressetilleggsnavn. Dersom dere mottar henvendelser om at bostedsadressen mangler adressetilleggsnavn, så kan dere hente adressen på nytt.</p>
    <p>Adressetilleggsnavnet er et tillegg til vegadressen. Dette gjelder for gårdsbruk, særlig kjente institusjoner eller bygninger, eller for grender, boligfelt, hyttefelt, osv. </p>

                <p>I henhold til §10.5 i folkeregisterloven skal informasjon om falsk identitet deles med offentlige mydigheter og virksomheter, samt finansinstitusjoner. </p>
    <p>I FREG har vi kun delt denne informasjonen i rettighetspakkene offentlig med hjemmel og finans. Torsdag 4. november vil vi starte å dele denne informasjonen også med offentlig uten hjemmel. Bakgrunnen for at vi ikke har gjort dette tidligere har vært at vi har hatt noen gjennbruk av dataene mellom offentlig uten hjemmel og privat.</p>
    <p>Rettighetspakken offentlig uten hjemmel vil populeres med nye data torsdag 4. november kl 16:00 og vi forventer å være ferdig klokken 19:00. </p>

                <p>Skatteetaten har i forbindelse med KVU for ny personidentifikator besluttet å øke kapasiteten på individnumrene for D-nummerpopulasjonen. Årsaken er at man ikke skal gå tom for D-numre i 2029. Serien vil holde fram til ny identifikator kommer i 2032, samt at færre personer vil få avvikende fødselsdato i D-nummeret med reell fødselsdato. For å øke kapasiteten vil Skatteetaten ved tildeling av nye D-numre benytte ubenyttede nummerserier fra perioden 1859-1899 og 1900-1939.</p>

                <h3>2021-03-20 - Preferert kontaktadresse  </h3>
                <p>Vi planlegger å ta vekk Preferert kontaktadresse fra Folkeregisteret. Dette betyr at vi slutter å distribuere både den pre-formatterte adressen og opplysning om hvilken adressetype som er preferert. </p>
    <p>Bakgrunn for endringen er at preferert kontaktadresse er ikke et lovpålagt felt i registeret, kun en ekstraservice som vi har valgt å tilby fra nytt folkeregister (FREG). FREG inneholder flere typer adresser enn det gamle registeret gjorde. For å hjelpe konsumentene med å velge hvilke adresse som egner seg best til å bruke ved utsending av brev, innførte vi preferert kontaktadresse. </p>
    <p>Målet med å innføre denne nye egenskapen er at innbygger selv kan styre hvor denne vil motta post fra avsendere i samfunnet samtidig som at forvaltningen av ordningen skulle bli billigst mulig for Folkeregisteret. I tillegg til den brukerstyrte muligheten har Freg-systemet utledet den prefererte kontaktadressen selv hvis personen ikke har valgt den selv.</p>
    <p>Nå har preferert kontaktadresse vært i produksjon en tid, og vår erfaring er at løsningen ikke er enkel å forvalte. Over tid så får vi flere tilfeller av innbygger sitt ønske ikke er i synk med gjeldende adresser. Da mottar konsumentene opplysning om hvilken type adresse som er preferert, mens selve adressen er blitt ugyldig. I tillegg så er det kompleksitet knyttet til adressegradering og spesielt klientadresser. Her ser vi at det blir avvik mellom hva innbygger ønsker, og hva vi har lov til å distribuere til de ulike konsumentene.
    Det er også utfordrende å kommunisere til innbyggerne at når de preferer en adresse, så kan vi bare oppfordre konsumenten til å bruke denne adressen, vi kan ikke pålegge konsumentene å bruke den.</p>
    <p>Vi ønsker en tilbakemelding på om dette har noen konsekvens for dere:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Bruker dere aktivt, eller planlegger å bruke, den pre-formatterte adressen vi i dag eksponerer i PreferertKontaktadresse?</li>
    <li>Kan dere evt. selv bestemme hvilken adresse som skal benyttes, basert på deres egne retningslinjer for dette i f.eks. kombinasjon med en evt. valgt adressetype?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Frist for tilbakemelding: 9. april 2021.</p>
